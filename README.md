dice_roller
===========

a dice_roller web-app

I started this little thing to roll dice on a web-page with the intent of connecting multiple users together so that
dice rolls could be shared between them. This was inspired by somone saying "We could play D&D on-line if only we could
see the dice roles"

I never did finish this, but I might come back to it as part of my learning process. I'm soon to start playing with
AngularJS
